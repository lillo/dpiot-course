* Exercise 1
Write a TCP server that listens on port 9999. When a client connects, the server
answers by sending today's date (see [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html][java.util.Calendar]]), and then it closes the
connection. Finally, write a TCP client to test your server.

* Exercise 2
Extend the previous exercise as follow.  When the client connects, it first
sends a message with a time zone id (see [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html][java.util.TimeZone]]).  Then, the server
answers by sending today's date in the requested time zone.

* Exercise 3
Re-implement Exercise 2 using the UDP protocol.

* Exercise 4
Write a program that takes a URL of a web page as parameter, downloads the
requested page and extracts all URL it links.

* Exercise 5
Write a TCP file server that listens for incoming connections on port 2018. The
server manages the directory ~dbox~ and allows clients to operate on files in
that directory.  In particular, the server can answer the following requests:

| Operation name | Description                                              |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~ls~           | return the list of files inside ~dbox~                   |
| ~cat file~     | return the content of ~file~                             |
| ~rm file~      | remove the ~file~ and return the result of the operation |


Test your server using the ~telnet~ command line tool.
