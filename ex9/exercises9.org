* Exercise 1
Re-implement the remote clock service of [[../ex3/exercises3.org][Exercise 3 of problem set 3]] using CoAP.
Then, write a client to test your implementation.
Finally, compare your solution with the one of [[../ex3/exercises3.org][Exercise 3 of problem set 3]].

* Exercise 2
Extend the CoAP service TempSensor discussed during the class for handling POST
requests.  Write a client that tests your service by performing both GET and
POST requests using different values for the parameter kind.

* Exercise 3
Extend the CoAP service of exercise 1 by making the resource /observable/.  The
resource must change its state every second and must notify the changes to all
interested clients.
Finally, write a client that observes the resource.
