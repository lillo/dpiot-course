* Exercise 1
Write a program that uses the REST service [[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/][JSONPlaceholder]] to retrieve:
 1) the comments of the post number 1
 2) the posts of the user with id 1
 3) the photos from the album with id 2.

* Exercise 2
Extend the REST service TempSensor discussed during the class with a new
resource method for handling POST requests.  Write a REST client that tests your
service by performing both GET and POST requests using different values
for the parameter kind.

* Exercise 3
Write a REST resource that implements a clock that returns the current time and
today's date (see [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html][java.util.Calendar]]). The client can specify a time zone for
the output by using the parameter ~zone~.  If no ~zone~ is provided, the clock
returns the current time in GMT (see [[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TimeZone.html][java.util.TimeZone]]).
Then, write a client to test your service.
Finally, compare your solution with the solution of [[../ex1/exercises1.org][Exercise 2 of problem set 1]].
